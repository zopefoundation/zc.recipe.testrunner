1.2.1 (2010-08-24)
==================

- Fixed a lot of windows issues
- Nailed versions to ZTK 1.0a2 (oh well, we have to have at least some stability)
- Fixed some other test failures that seemed to come from other packages

1.2.0 (2009-03-23)
==================

- Added a relative-paths option to use egg, test, and
  working-directory paths relative to the test script.


1.1.0 (2008-08-25)
==================

- Requiring at least zope.testing 3.6.0.

1.0.0 (2007-11-04)
==================

- Preparing stable release.


1.0.0b8 (2007-07-17)
====================

- Added the ability to use `initialization` option that will be inserted into
  the bin/test after the environment is set up.

1.0.0b7 (2007-04-26)
====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added optional option `environment` that allows defining a section in your
  buildout.cfg to specify environment variables that should be set before
  running the tests.

1.0.0b6 (2007-02-25)
====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- If the working directory is not specified, or specified as the empty
  string, an empty part directory is created for the tests to run in.

1.0.0b5 (2007-01-24)
====================

Bugs fixed
----------

- When:

  + the working-directory option was used,
  + and the test runner needed to restart itself
  + and the test runner was run with a relative path (e.g. bin/test)

  then the testrunner could not restart itself successfully because the
  relative path in sys.argv[0] was no-longer valid.

  Now we convert sys.argv[0] to an absolute path.

1.0.0b4 (2006-10-24)
====================

Feature Changes
---------------

  the generated script.
